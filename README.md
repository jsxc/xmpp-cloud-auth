# xmpp-cloud-auth

This authentication script for [ejabberd](https://www.ejabberd.im) and [prosody](https://prosody.im) allows to authenticate against a
[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com)/[Owncloud](https://owncloud.org) instance running [OJSXC](https://www.jsxc.org) (>= 3.2.0).


## Quick installation
[Full step-by-step instructions to install *Nextcloud* with an external XMPP server](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/wiki/) are in the wiki.

Download [xcauth.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/master/xcauth.py) and
put it to your desired location or clone this repository to simplify updates:
```
cd /opt
sudo git clone https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth
```

Create the `xcauth` user and directories:
```
sudo ./install.sh
```

Install Python and all desired libraries.
```
sudo apt install python python-requests python-configargparse python-bcrypt
```

## Configuration

:warning: The API secret must not fall into the wrong hands!
Anyone knowing it can authenticate as any user to the XMPP server
(and create arbitrary new users).

1. Copy `xcauth.conf` to `/etc` as root and restrict the access rights
   (e.g., `chown ejabberd /etc/xcauth.conf; chmod 600 /etc/xcauth.conf`)
1. Modify `/etc/xcauth.conf` according to your environment. The values for
   API URL and API SECRET can be found in your Nextcloud/ownCloud JSXC admin page.
1. Adapt your ejabberd/prosody configuration to use this authentication script:

### ejabberd
Adjust your configuration as described in the [admin manual](https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/configuration/#external-script).
```
vim /etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.yml

auth_method: external
extauth_program: "/opt/xmpp-cloud-auth/xcauth.sh"
```
:warning: On Ubuntu, `ejabberd` will come with an **apparmor** profile which will block the external authentication script.
See also the related issue [ejabberd#1598](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/1598).

:warning: This starts `xcauth.sh`, as some **ejabberd** installations will lead to shared library conflicts,
preventing HTTPS access from within Python. The shell wrapper prevents this conflict.
([ejabberd#1756](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/1756))

:warning: Starting with *ejabberd 17.06* (which has a security problem,
so please update to 17.07 or later), *ejabberd* uses a built-in authentication
cache, which is enabled by default, but not (yet) documented in the
[*ejabberd* configuration documentation](https://docs.ejabberd.im/admin/configuration/).
This cache interferes with multiple valid passwords (app passwords, tokens)
and thus needs to be deactivated with `auth_use_cache: false`.

### Prosody
Install *lua-lpty* (not necessary when using the new (experimental) *socket mode*):
```
apt install lua-lpty
```

Add the following to your config:
```
authentication = "external"
external_auth_command = "/opt/xmpp-cloud-auth/xcauth.py"
```
:warning: The Prosody `mod_auth_external.lua` only accepts a command name, no parameters
([xmpp-cloud-auth#2](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/issues/2), [Prosody#841](https://prosody.im/issues/issue/841)).
All parameters must therefore be set in the configuration file.

:warning: Use the `mod_auth_external.lua` in this repository.
This fixes a bug with treating an echo of the request as the answer
([xmpp-cloud-auth#21](https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth/issues/21), [Prosody#855](https://prosody.im/issues/issue/855)).

XMPP server authentication against JSXC>=3.2.0 on Nextcloud. See
https://jsxc.org or https://github.com/jsxc/xmpp-cloud-auth. Args that start
with '--' (eg. -u) can also be set in a config file (/etc/xcauth.conf or
/etc/external_cloud.conf or ./xcauth.conf or specified via -c). Config file
syntax allows: key=value, flag=true, stuff=[a,b,c] (for details, see syntax at
https://goo.gl/R74nmi). If an arg is specified in more than one place, then
commandline values override config file values which override defaults.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG_FILE, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        config file path
  -u URL, --url URL     base URL
  -s SECRET, --secret SECRET
                        secure api token
  -l LOG, --log LOG     log directory (default: /var/log/xcauth)
  -p PER_DOMAIN_CONFIG, --per-domain-config PER_DOMAIN_CONFIG
                        name of file containing whitespace-separated (domain,
                        secret, url) tuples
  -b DOMAIN_DB, --domain-db DOMAIN_DB
                        persistent domain database; manipulated with -G, -P,
                        -D, -L, -U
  -d, --debug           enable debug mode
  -i, --interactive     log to stdout
  -t {generic,prosody,ejabberd,saslauthd}, --type {generic,prosody,ejabberd,saslauthd}
                        XMPP server type (prosody=generic); implies reading
                        requests from stdin
  --timeout TIMEOUT     Timeout for each of connection setup and request
                        processing
  --cache-db CACHE_DB   Database path for the user cache; enables cache if set
  --cache-query-ttl CACHE_QUERY_TTL
                        Maximum time between queries
  --cache-verification-ttl CACHE_VERIFICATION_TTL
                        Maximum time between backend verifications
  --cache-unreachable-ttl CACHE_UNREACHABLE_TTL
                        Maximum cache time when backend is unreachable
                        (overrides the other TTLs)
  --cache-bcrypt-rounds CACHE_BCRYPT_ROUNDS
                        Encrypt passwords with 2^ROUNDS before storing (i.e.,
                        every increasing ROUNDS takes twice as much
                        computation time)
  -A USER DOMAIN PASSWORD, --auth-test USER DOMAIN PASSWORD
                        single, one-shot query of the user, domain, and
                        password triple
  -I USER DOMAIN, --isuser-test USER DOMAIN
                        single, one-shot query of the user and domain tuple
  --version             show program's version number and exit

-A takes precedence over -I over -t. -A and -I imply -d. -A, -I, -G, -P, -D,
-L, and -U imply -i. The database operations require -b.
```

Note that `-t generic` is identical to `-t prosody`. This is just to indicate
that new applications should pick the line-based protocol instead of the `ejabberd`
length-prefixed protocol. (*Prosody* `mod_auth_external.lua` calls the protocol
`generic` as well.)

If only a single (API secret, API url) tuple is defined (the one in the configuration file or on the command line), then this one will be used for all requests.
If additional per-domain-configuration entries are given (via the `-p` option), then if the domain equals one in this per-domain configuration, the parameters
there will take precedence over the global, fallback tuple. You generally will only need this if you operate a single XMPP server providing service
to multiple cloud instances.

For information about the caching system, see [Cache.md](Cache.md)

## Commands
When using `xmpp-cloud-auth.py` in `-t` mode (reading commands from stdin), the following commands are recognized:

* `auth:<USER>:<DOMAIN>:<PASSWORD>`: Is this the PASSWORD for the given USER (in the given DOMAIN)?
* `isuser:<USER>:<DOMAIN>`: Does this USER exist (in the given DOMAIN)?
* `roster:<USER>:<DOMAIN>`: Return the shared roster information. Nonstandard, only useful with `-t generic`
* `quit` and `exit`: Terminate (for interactive commands, especially over a socket connection)
* EOF: Terminate


## Troubleshooting
In case you need some additional debugging, you can try and run `xcauth.py` from the command line with the usual options and then add `-A jane.doe example.com p4ssw0rd` to test the connection to the ownCloud/Nextcloud server.

If Conversations cannot connect and complains about "Downgrade attack", see the following issue:
[No (obvious?) way to accept SASL downgrade (Conversations#2498)](https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues/2498).
Current workaround: Delete the account in Conversations and then add it again.

### Experimental socket interface

If you see unreliable behavior with *Prosody*, you might want to try the experimental socket interface.
When using the `mod_auth_external.lua` bundled here (together with `pseudolpty.lua`), you can use
the `external_auth_command = "@localhost:23664";` option to talk over a socket to a process not spawned
by *Prosody* on port 23664. [systemd/README.md](systemd/README.md) explains how to automatically start
such a process using *systemd*.

### Experimental *saslauthd* compatibility

In an attempt to move toward Nextcloud as the main authentication source,
a new `-t saslauthd` mode is supported, which allows to run services
which can authenticate against Cyrus *saslauthd* to authenticate against
JSXC and Nextcloud. It has been successfully tested against *Postfix*
and *Cyrus IMAP*. More information can be found in
[systemd/README.md (*saslauthd* mode)](systemd/README.md#saslauthd-mode)

## How does it work?
Your XMPP server sends the authentication data in a [special format](https://www.ejabberd.im/files/doc/dev.html#htoc9) on the standard input to the authentication script, length-prefixed (`-t ejabberd`) for *ejabberd*, newline-terminated (`-t prosody` aka `-t generic`) for *Prosody* (and maybe others). The script will first try to verify the given password as time-limited token and if this fails, it will send a HTTP request to your cloud installation to verify this data. To protect your Nextcloud/Owncloud against different attacks, every request has a signature similar to the  [github webhook signature]( https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/).

More information can be found in [Protocol.md](Protocol.md).
