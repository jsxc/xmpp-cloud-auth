# Testing

For testing, we use `nose`. This probably can be installed using
```sh
apt install python3-nose python3-rednose python3-nose-cov
```
or
```sh
pip3 install nose rednose nose-cov
```
on your system. To run the tests, type
```sh
nosetests3
```
or (if you also want coverage information),
```sh
nosetests3 --with-coverage --cover-package=xclib
```
in this directory. Some of the tests will only run,
if `/etc/xcauth.accounts` exists. Then, it will read
tab-separated username/password pairs from that file
and use the settings in `/etc/xcauth.conf` to verify
those passwords. Additionally, it will assume that
a user `nosuchuser` **does not exist**. Please make
sure that only authorized users can read these
configuration files.

The full command-line tool can be tested when typing
```sh
tests/run-online.pl /etc/xcauth.accounts
```
in the current directory.
This will also use `/etc/xcauth.accounts`, so this
needs to exist together with your valid `/etc/xcauth.conf`.

## Format of `/etc/xcauth.accounts`
Line-based, tab-separated file with the following fields:

### Lines not starting with a tab
1. login
2. domain (typically your default domain)
3. password

### Lines starting with a tab
1. (empty, before the first tab)
2. command: isuser, auth, roster
3. expected response

### Lines starting with '#' and empty lines will be ignored

### Example file
The table column separators will be single tabs in the real file.
